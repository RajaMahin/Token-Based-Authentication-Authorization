# 🔐 Token-Based Authentication & Authorization in ASP.NET Core

This project is a fully functional implementation of **Token-Based Authentication and Authorization** built with **.NET Core Web API**. It was developed while completing the [LinkedIn Learning Course on ASP.NET Core Token-Based Authentication](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/asp-dot-net-core-token-based-authentication), and is designed to demonstrate secure, scalable authentication flows using JWTs and refresh tokens.

## ✨ What This Project Covers

✅ Built with **ASP.NET Core Identity** for user & role management  
✅ Implements **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication  
✅ Supports **User Registration**, **Login**, and **Access Token Generation**  
✅ Implements **Refresh Token** logic for long-lived sessions  
✅ Secures endpoints using `[Authorize]` and **role-based authorization**  
✅ Demonstrates **token validation**, revocation, and claims-based access  
✅ Cleanly structured using services, models, and controller separation  
✅ Integrated with **Entity Framework Core** and **SQL Server**
